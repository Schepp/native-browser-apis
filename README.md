The Breakthrough of Native Browser APIs
======

Talk Slides: [https://schepp.github.io/native-browser-apis/](https://schepp.github.io/native-browser-apis/)

---

In this talk, I will give you an overview on how far native browser APIs have matured, thus freeing our sites from the grips of jQuery, lodash and other helper libraries. We will look at working more elegantly with arrays and objects in JavaScript, at modern DOM traversal and manipulation possibilities, at event delegation, at native smooth scrolling, look at ways to build carousels without library, we will explore built-in tools for image and font lazy loading, and we will bury DOMContentLoaded forever.

> Christian Schaefer (https://twitter.com/derSchepp), known as "Schepp", is a freelance frontend developer from DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. Instead of hacking around with JS-Frameworks as almost every other frontend developer currently does, he works on traditional server-rendered component-based systems, uses bleeding edge CSS, has an eye on accessibility as well as the loading and runtime performance of a site. And then he also organizes a meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Webworker-NRW/) and co-hosts a podcast (https://workingdraft.de/).
